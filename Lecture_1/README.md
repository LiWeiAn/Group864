# Assignments for Lecture 1

For the first lecture, tutorials on XACRO and URDF were done. Furthermore, the environment of the factory was built and modified. Finally, an additional UR5 and an ABB 6640 were added to the factory environment.

For these assignments, replace the existing "omtp_factory.xacro" with the one in this foder.

* Run `$ rosrun xacroxacro--inorderomtp_factory.xacro> omtp.urdf` in order to transform the XACRO file into a URDF file.
* Run `roslaunch omtp_supportvisualize_omtp_factory.launch` in order to visualize the factory in Rviz.
